# Phase 0 — Algorithms & Logic 🔰

## Objective

The goal of this phase is to **develop logical thinking and problem-solving skills** using Java, without introducing Object-Oriented Programming yet.

This phase focuses on learning **how to think like a programmer**, not on frameworks, architecture, or advanced language features.

---

## What You Will Learn

* Variables and data types
* Conditional logic (`if / else`)
* Loops (`for`, `while`)
* Methods and basic modularization
* Input and output
* Lists and basic collections

---

## Rules of This Phase

* ❌ No Object-Oriented Programming (no classes modeling domains)
* ❌ No frameworks
* ✅ Focus on clarity and correctness
* ✅ Simple, readable code
* ✅ One problem at a time

> The goal is not performance or optimization, but **clear reasoning and correctness**.

## Problems

Each problem has **two versions**:

* **Unsolved version**

  * Contains the problem statement
  * May include partial code or TODOs

* **Solved version**

  * Complete implementation
  * Focused on readability
  * Uses simple logic and clear variable names

Problems are intentionally small and incremental.

---

## Commit Strategy

Each problem should be committed separately.

Examples:

```
feat: add problem 1 unsolved version
feat: add problem 1 solved version
fix: correct loop condition in problem 2
```

---

## Review & Mentorship

All solutions are open for review and refactoring in later phases.
Feedback focuses on:

* Logical flow
* Naming
* Readability
* Correct use of control structures

---

## Why This Phase Matters

Strong backend developers:

* Think clearly
* Break problems into steps
* Write code that others can understand

This phase builds the **foundation** for everything that comes next.

---

📌 *This phase intentionally avoids Object-Oriented concepts. They will be introduced in Phase 2.*
