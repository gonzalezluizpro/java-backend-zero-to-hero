# Phase 0 — Algorithms & Logic (Java 21)

## Objective
Build a solid programming and problem-solving foundation using Java 21, focusing on clarity, correctness, and enterprise-oriented thinking.

## Key Concepts
- Control flow
- Business rules
- State management
- Defensive programming

## Why This Matters
These concepts form the foundation of backend systems in regulated environments such as banking and financial services.

## CI/CD

This project uses **Azure DevOps Pipelines** integrated with **GitHub**.

Pipeline responsibilities in Phase 0:
- Compile Java code
- Ensure code integrity on every commit
- Prepare the project for enterprise-grade CI/CD in later phases
