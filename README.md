# Java Backend Zero to Hero 🚀

This repository documents my **Java Backend learning journey**, going from
**fundamental programming logic** to **production-ready backend services**.

The goal is not only to learn Java syntax, but to **think like a backend developer**:
clean code, architecture, responsibility separation and real-world practices.

---

## 🧭 Learning Philosophy

- Learn **how to think**, not just tools
- Build concepts step by step
- Small commits, clear explanations
- Code that can be read and understood by others

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### 🔰 Phase 0 — Algorithms & Logic (Days 1–10)
**Goal:** Think like a programmer.

**Topics:**
- Variables
- If / Else
- Loops
- Methods
- Input / Output
- Lists

**Challenges:**
- Problems 1 to 4
- Solved and unsolved versions

---

### 🧩 Phase 2 — Object-Oriented Programming (Days 21–35)
**Goal:** Model the domain.

**Topics:**
- Classes and objects
- Encapsulation
- State vs behavior

**Mini-project:**
- User
- UserService
- UserRepository (in-memory)

### 🏗️ Phase 3 — Backend Architecture (Days 36–55)
**Goal:** Think like a backend developer.

**Topics:**
- Controller
- Service
- Domain
- Repository
- SOLID principles (practical)

**Project:**
- `user-management-core` (no Spring)
